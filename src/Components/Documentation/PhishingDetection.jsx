              <strong className="text-orange-400 mb-4"> Build a Model:</strong> The first step in identifying phishing emails is to build a machine-learning model. Although the model type isnâ€™t stated in the flowchart, Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular option for this kind of work.

              <strong className="text-orange-400 mb-4">Establish Flask API:</strong> The creation of a Flask API is the task of this step. A well-liked Python framework for creating web apps and APIs is called Flask. The API will probably offer a mechanism for other components of your system to communicate with the machine-learning model.

            <li >
              <strong className="text-orange-400 mb-4"> Create API Requests from React.js:</strong> This phase involves creating requests from a React.js application to the Flask API. A JavaScript package called React.js is used to create user interfaces. Emails would probably be sent to the API for phishing detection by the React.js application.

One kind of probabilistic machine learning model that performs well on text categorization problems is the naive Bayes classifier.
