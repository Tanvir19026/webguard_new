            <li>
              <strong  className="text-orange-400 mb-4"> CDN:</strong> A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of geographically dispersed computers that can assist in distributing and absorbing DDoS assault traffic. The CDN can divert traffic from the origin server during a DDoS assault, assisting in maintaining the website or applicationâ€™s online presence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong  className="text-orange-400 mb-4"> Load Balancing:</strong> One method for distributing incoming traffic among several servers is load balancing. This can lessen the likelihood that a DDoS assault will overwhelm a single server.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong  className="text-orange-400 mb-4"> Rate Limiting:</strong> This method limits the number of requests that a specific IP address or user can make to the server in a predetermined amount of time. By doing this, attackers may be deterred from overloading the server with requests.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong  className="text-orange-400 mb-4"> Cloud-Based DDoS Protection:</strong> Services offering cloud-based DDoS protection can offer a thorough defense against DDoS attacks. These services can mitigate assaults and filter out harmful traffic before it reaches the origin server.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong className="text-orange-400 mb-4">Incident Response Plan:</strong> A collection of protocols that ought to be adhered to in the case of a DDoS assault is known as an incident response plan. The strategy should provide instructions on how to recognize an assault, react to it, and recover from it.
